# Paint-Application-Using-Python-OpenCV
Project utilizes python basic syntax complex data structures and use of the OpenCV and Deque library

Stage 1: Basic Drawing Functionality
OpenCV Basics:

Learn to use OpenCV to create a window and display an image.
Understand how to capture mouse events in OpenCV.
Practice basic image manipulation using OpenCV (e.g., drawing shapes, lines, and circles).
Creating the Drawing Canvas:

Initialize a blank canvas using NumPy arrays.
Implement functions to handle drawing on the canvas using mouse events.
Enable basic drawing tools such as pencil and eraser.
Stage 2: Advanced Drawing Tools
Tool Selection and Modes:

Implement a toolbar for selecting different drawing tools (e.g., pencil, eraser, line, rectangle, circle).
Create a mode system to switch between different drawing tools.
Implementing Drawing Functions:

Develop functions for each drawing tool (e.g., draw line, draw rectangle, draw circle).
Ensure smooth drawing by handling mouse movement and clicks appropriately.
Color and Thickness Options:

Add functionality to choose different colors and thicknesses for drawing tools.
Implement a color palette and thickness slider.
Stage 3: Undo and Redo Functionality
Using the Deque Library:

Learn how to use the deque library to manage a sequence of actions for undo and redo functionality.
Implement a system to push drawing actions onto a deque stack.
Undo and Redo Actions:

Develop functions to undo the last action and redo an undone action.
Ensure the canvas updates correctly after each undo and redo operation.

Stage 4: Saving and Loading Images
Image Saving:

Implement functionality to save the current canvas as an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
Use OpenCV functions to write images to disk.
Image Loading:

Add functionality to load an existing image onto the canvas.
Ensure the loaded image integrates seamlessly with the current drawing state.
Stage 5: User Interface and Polishing
Improving the User Interface:

Enhance the UI with a better layout, tool icons, and a user-friendly interface.
Use OpenCV or other libraries like Tkinter for creating a more polished UI.
Final Touches:

Add finishing touches, such as a splash screen, about section, or help menu.
Ensure the application is stable and free of bugs.
